# Teuku Fazariz Basya

**Software Engineer · iOS & Apple Platforms**

I build software for the Apple ecosystem with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and reliability.  

Lately, I’ve been exploring game development and machine learning, mostly out of curiosity and a desire to understand systems more deeply.

I value learning, iteration, and building things that hold up over time.

I also love cats and music, two of my favorite things.
